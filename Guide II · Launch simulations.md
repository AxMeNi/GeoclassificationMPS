## I. 1. The data
### ⮕ The Numpy (.npy) format
- All the raw data provided to the project must be in a form of 2D numpy arrays.
- All the data files must be loaded in the Numpy format (see "[.npy](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.lib.format.html)" for more information about the .npy format).
- This format is used for its simplicity and its ubiquity.
### ⮕ The CSV (.csv) file
- Every data file used must be carefully logged in a .csv file as the one provided in the [data](https://github.com/AxMeNi/GeoclassificationMPS/tree/main/data) folder
