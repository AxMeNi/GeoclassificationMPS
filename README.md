# GeoclassificationMPS

---
## Scope
This project focuses on the development and evaluation of indicators to assess the quality of Training Images (TIs) used in Multiple-Point Statistics (MPS) simulations, specifically within the context of geological mapping. The DeeSse project objects are used and the LoopUI indicators are tested. The test data provided come from the mining site of Mount Isa (QL, Australia). 

## Authors
- Axel MENGELLE NICOLE (coding, project design)
- Guillaume PIROT (coding, debugging, supervision)
