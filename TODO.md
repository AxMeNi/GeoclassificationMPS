# TODO list

### TO DEBUG
- [ ] The function plot_mask in display_functions (works with the test function, but not with the masks used in the simulation)
---
### WIP
- [ ] The case nRandomTICDsets > 1 in launcher.py (still few bugs that require a complete inspection of the current implementation)
- [ ] Adjust the colors of the global MDS plot to emphasize the differences
- [ ] Modify the CSV file header for the data_csv (remove the "grid" column or find a utility)
- [ ] An optimization of the method ReducedTiSg in reduced_ti_sg.py to make it run faster.
---
### TO IMPLEMENT
- [ ] All tests flagged as #TODO in main.py
- [ ] The function execute_shorter_program in interface.py
- [ ] Adding the parameter numberOfMasks (which changes the seed).
- [ ] Dividing the function calculate_indicators in variability.py in several smaller functions.
